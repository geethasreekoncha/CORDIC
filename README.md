# CORDIC Algorithm

### This repository contains Verilog code for rotaion mode and vectoring mode CORDIC algorithms. Various trignometric functions like sine and cosine can be implemented using rotation mode and vectoring mode CORDIC algorithm. Piplining is used to compute certain trignometric functions using CORDIC to improve throughput and reduce number of total clock cycles.
